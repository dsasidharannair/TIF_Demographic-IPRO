# TIF_Demographic-IPRO

**About the Project:**
Our project delves into investigating the relationship between the demographics of Tax Increment Financing (TIF) districts and the allocation of funds within them. Inspired by CivicLab's TIF illumination project, which highlighted disparities in TIF fund distribution based on race in Chicago, our aim is to broaden this analysis to encompass various demographic factors such as age, religion, ethnicity, and more. By exploring potential correlations between demographics and TIF fund allocation, we seek to identify any inequities that may exist within the system.

This research is vital as it serves as a foundational step towards advocating for more equitable TIF policies. By gathering and presenting statistical evidence of potential disparities in fund allocation, we aim to inform policymakers and stakeholders, ultimately fostering dialogue and action towards creating fairer TIF policies.
