## About the Project:
Our project delves into investigating the relationship between the demographics of Tax Increment Financing (TIF) districts and the allocation of funds within them. Inspired by CivicLab's TIF illumination project, which highlighted disparities in TIF fund distribution based on race in Chicago, our aim is to broaden this analysis to encompass various demographic factors such as age, income level, ethnicity, and more. By exploring potential correlations between demographics and TIF fund allocation, we seek to identify any inequities that may exist within the system.

This research is vital as it serves as a foundational step towards advocating for more equitable TIF policies. By gathering and presenting statistical evidence of potential disparities in fund allocation, we aim to inform policymakers and stakeholders, ultimately fostering dialogue and action towards creating fairer TIF policies.

## What is the problem?

A Tax Increment Financing (TIF) district is a designated area where property taxes are frozen at a certain level for a set period of time. Any increase in district property tax revenue brought about by development or improvements goes toward a special fund instead of the regular tax base. The district then uses this money, often referred to as the tax increment, to fund projects related to economic development, infrastructure development, or other improvements meant to promote further development. In order to fund current development projects, TIF districts leverage future growth through a gradual rise in property tax income within the designated area. They are designed to bring private investment to places that might otherwise find it difficult to draw development naturally, to stimulate economic growth, and to restore neglected areas.

Chicago has historically had a problem with allocating funds for government programs in an equitable manner. Many demographics have largely been underfunded, ignored, or discriminated against which has snowballed into larger and larger inequalities between groups of people such as gaps in wealth, income, education, health, and crime. Addressing these issues is an important step to help uplift these groups and correct the wrongs of the past. If we are able to find correlations that show certain demographics are being treated unequally when it comes to distributing TIF funds, then these issues can be addressed and corrected by crafting and passing better policies. 

### Purpose of Census Tracts in the analysis

Due to their tiny geographic size, census tracts provide a granular level of detail when gathering demographic data within TIF districts, enabling more accurate analysis of population trends and features within certain locations. We can precisely identify the percentage of each census tract that is contained inside a TIF district by crossing the boundaries of the census tracts with TIF district boundaries and computing the ratio of intersection. With this method, we can more precisely estimate the population and demographic data inside TIF areas. In Chicago, community areas are more expansive geographic areas that include many census tracts. Community areas might not adequately represent the subtle distinctions seen within individual census tracts, even though they offer a broader view of demographic patterns throughout the city. Therefore, within TIF districts, census tracts provide a more appropriate and extensive geographic unit for collecting demographic data.

## Problem Approaches
This section will go into detail about the approach we took to tackle this problem and why.
### Data Collection
The first step of the approach was collecting our data. This included the Civic Lab report data on TIFs; City of Chicago data portal geojson files for TIF, census tract, and community area boundaries; and US Census data at the census tract level for Cook County. We will provide links for all of these datasets and provide information as to why we used them.
### Data Preparation
This next step included preparing our data before performing our statistical analysis. In the process of data preparation for our statistical analysis, meticulous steps were taken to ensure the reliability and coherence of the datasets utilized. Initial efforts involved amalgamating demographic data sourced at the census tract level, encompassing key indicators such as racial population distribution, median household income stratified by race, median property values, and property tax figures. To accurately contextualize these demographic insights within the framework of TIF (Tax Increment Financing) districts, an additional layer of complexity was introduced: the determination of the overlap ratio between census tracts and TIF districts. Leveraging the assumption of even population distribution across census tracts, estimations of population breakdown by race were derived for each TIF district. This nuanced approach enabled the creation of a comprehensive dataset, which was subsequently merged with a TIF report dataset housing exhaustive information on fund allocation to TIFs. The resultant amalgamation of data sets facilitated our capacity to undertake robust exploratory analyses, illuminating the intricate correlations between demographic indicators and fund allocation within Chicago's TIF districts.
### Visualizations
This section will focus on going through our maps and how to interact with them, while also going through what each map is showing such as heat maps for TIF transfers, fund allocation, demographics, and income information.

### 1. Median Property Value Heat Map

<img src="https://github.com/dsasidharannair/TIF_Demographic-IPRO/blob/main/Map%20Images/Folium/Median%20Value.png" alt="TIF Transfers Heat Map" width="400">

The map is a heatmap that represents the median property values across Chicago's various census tracts, using a color scale that ranges from red to green. The color-coded outline of each census tract corresponds to its median property value, enabling a visual comparison of economic disparities within the city. The map can be read by looking at the color of a particular tract and using the color scale with the median value at the top in order to translate the color into a suitable range of property values. The darker the shade of green, the more expensive the properties in that area are, and conversely, the darker the shade of red, the less expensive the properties. 

The trend for increasingly costly real estate in these TIF regions is reflected in the heatmap of Chicago's median property values, which shows a noticeable gradient with greater values centered along the lakefront in East Chicago and the downtown area. While South and West Chicago primarily exhibit lower median property values, North Chicago exhibits a combination of greater and lower property values. The northern and center regions of the city appear to be wealthier than the southern and western regions, indicating a variation in real estate values.

### 2. Median Real Estate Tax Distribution Heat Map

<img src="https://github.com/dsasidharannair/TIF_Demographic-IPRO/blob/main/Map%20Images/Folium/Median%20Real%20Estate%20Tax.png" alt="Median Real Estate Tax Heat Map" width="400">

The above map uses a color scale, from red to green, to show the median real estate taxes of the various census tracts in Chicago. Red denotes lower tax values, while green denotes higher tax values. The color-coding and separation of the census tracts reflect the median tax value of each one. Viewers are able to understand the distribution of taxes around the city by referring to the color scale at the top of the map, which shows the precise range of taxes linked with each color. Tracts with the highest real estate taxes are indicated by dark green areas, while those with the lowest are indicated by dark red areas. 

Based on this heatmap, the distribution of median real estate taxes in Chicago shows a varied picture. Green-toned areas indicate census tracts with higher median real estate taxes, which are found in North Chicago and certain lakefront areas. This suggests a larger tax burden on real estate, which is frequently associated with greater property values and possibly more wealthy neighborhoods. Center, South, and West Chicago, on the other hand, have a more varied pattern, with some regions (yellow to light green areas) showing fairly high taxes and others (orange to red areas) showing lower taxes. 

### 3. Cumulative Property Tax Distribution Heat Map

<img src="https://github.com/dsasidharannair/TIF_Demographic-IPRO/blob/main/Map%20Images/Folium/Cumulative%20Property%20Tax%20Distribution.png" alt="Cumulative Property Tax Distribution Heat Map" width="400">

With a color scale that goes from red for smaller quantities of tax income received to green for higher amounts, the heatmap shows the cumulative property tax taken for Tax Increment Financing (TIF) across Chicago's census tracts. To read this map, you can identify the color of a tract and compare it to the color scale provided at the top, which quantifies the tax revenue. Darker shades of green suggest higher tax revenues, while darker red tones indicate areas with poor tax collection. Understanding the economic contribution of various areas to TIF is made easier with the help of this visualization, which also might show trends in city investment and development.

The map exhibits the varied distribution pattern of cumulative property tax contributions made by people of Chicago. The greener tones indicate greater contributions from the northern areas and parts of North West Chicago. These areas typically have higher property values, potentially translating to larger tax increments for TIF. The pattern in Central Chicago is more varied, with certain tracts contributing more and others less. By contrast, the majority of South and West Chicago exhibit lesser TIF contributions, as indicated by the red colors.

### 4. White Community Population Distribution Estimate Heat Map

<img src="https://github.com/dsasidharannair/TIF_Demographic-IPRO/blob/main/Map%20Images/Folium/White%20Population%20Estimate.png" alt="White Population Distribution Estimate Heat Map" width="400">

This heatmap, utilizing a color spectrum from red to green, shows how the white population is distributed throughout the census tracts of Chicago. Green denotes locations with a greater concentration of white people, whereas red denotes areas with fewer white people. Based on the scale at the top of the map, the color intensity corresponds to the number of White people in each tract. By contrasting the colors of each census tract with the color scale, viewers are able to determine the approximate number of the white population in various regions of the city.

The distribution of the white population in Chicago varies significantly, as can be seen by looking at the heat map. The map displays areas with a greater number of white people as greener regions. These areas seem to be more common in the northern parts of Chicago, near the lakefront. The red colors, on the other hand, represent a smaller number of white people in the city's southern and western areas. 

### 5. Black Community Population Distribution Estimate Heat Map

<img src="https://github.com/dsasidharannair/TIF_Demographic-IPRO/blob/main/Map%20Images/Folium/Black%20Population%20Estimate.png" alt="Black Community Population Distribution Estimate HeatMap" width="400">

The map that is being presented above is a heat map of the distribution of Black / African American population in Chicago census tracts. It utilizes a color gradient, where areas with a lower population are represented by red, and those with a larger population by green. By comparing each census tract's color intensity with the color scale at the top, you can calculate a  numerical estimate of the population size. Deeper green colors are associated with higher concentrations of Black and African American residents, whereas deeper red colors are associated with lesser concentration of same community. 

The heat map shows that there are numerous places in Chicago where the Black and African American population is predominant. Greener tones are utilized to highlight the city's southern and western regions, which indicate that these census tracts have denser populations. Conversely, the redder colors represent lower populations in the northern and some eastern regions. 

### 6. Hispanic Community Population Distribution Estimate Heat Map

<img src="https://github.com/dsasidharannair/TIF_Demographic-IPRO/blob/main/Map%20Images/Folium/Hispanic%20Population%20Estimate.png" alt="Hispanic Community Population Distribution Estimate Heat Map" width="400">

The map illustrates the distribution of the Hispanic population within Chicago's census tracts. Using a color scale ranging from red to green, which indicates areas with a lower Hispanic population and green areas with a larger Hispanic population, the map shows the distribution of the Hispanic population within Chicago's census tracts. Viewers can use the color scale at the top to interpret the numerical population estimates for each color range. The color depth represents the density of the people. Tracts with denser Hispanic populations are shown by deeper greens, whereas those with sparser Hispanic populations are indicated by darker reds. 

The heatmap indicates higher concentrations of the hispanic community in certain sectors of Chicago, especially in areas that show as darker green. These are more common in the western portions of the city and in a few communities close to the city center. The orange and yellow tones suggest that there is also a noticeable presence in the southwest regions.  The red colored tracts indicate that the Hispanic population appears to be smaller in the northern and eastern areas.

### 7. TIF Transfer Heatmap (Total Transferred / Total Tax Collected)
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dsasidharannair/TIF_Demographic-IPRO/main/Transfers/TIF_Transfer_Images/TransferMap1.png" alt="Hispanic Community Population Distribution Estimate Heat Map" width="400">

This map above visualizes the amount of money a TIF district transfers in or out of their district. The figures are normalized by dividing the amount transferred in/out to the total tax collected by that district. This map aggregates all the transfers from 2014 to 2022 to give a holistic view of how the TIF transfers have trended in the 8 year period. Most TIF districts have very small transfers relative to the amount of tax they collect since a lot of the figure remain between 0.3 and -0.3

### 8. TIF Transfer Heatmap (Discrete Values)
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dsasidharannair/TIF_Demographic-IPRO/main/Transfers/TIF_Transfer_Images/TransferMap2.png" alt="Hispanic Community Population Distribution Estimate Heat Map" width="400">

This map above visualizes the amount of money a TIF district transfers in or out of their district. The figures above are discrete figures where yellow represents an overall larger sum of transfers in than transfers out, pink represents an equal weightage, and purple represents an overall larger sum of transfers out than transfers in. This map aggregates all the transfers from 2014 to 2022 to give a holistic view of how the TIF transfers have trended in the 8 year period. As you can see, there is a lot more variation in the map compared to the one above.

### 8. TIF Transfer Heatmap By Demographic

This maps above visualizes the amount of money a TIF district transfers in or out of their district. The dataset from #7 is divided up by demographic. The figures are normalized by dividing the amount transferred in/out to the total tax collected by that district. The figures above are discrete figures where yellow represents an overall larger sum of transfers in than transfers out, pink represents an equal weightage, and purple represents an overall larger sum of transfers out than transfers in. This map aggregates all the transfers from 2014 to 2022 to give a holistic view of how the TIF transfers have trended in the 8 year period. 

The data shows that many of the TIF districts received a mixed amount of positive and negative transfers. This leads us to believe that there is little noticeable discrimination in the way the City of Chicago conducts it's TIF transfer policy decisions. However, the dataset was limited. In the future, we would like to further analyze aspects about the projects that were being funded as well as get data of TIF transfers prior to 2014 to explore for any patterns of discrimination as well. 

### Regression
This section will go through the statistical analysis we have conducted to try to look into the problem that we are investigating. We will use regression to answer the following questions:
- Have TIFs helped low-income communities?
- Does TIF district demographics determine whether funds are transferred (in or out)?
	- We attempted to train various different models in order to try and predict two different target variables. The first was the amount of money a TIF district would be transferred. Here a positive value meant a transfer in and a negative value meant a transfer out. The predictors were the racial demographic makeup of the TIF districts, specifically the White, Black, Asian, and Hispanic demographics.
	- We trained a Multi-Linear Regression model. This model does not require much preprocessing because the model is pretty simple. However, the model was not able to fit the data well with a Mean Squared Error of  18990423612549.88
	- We also trained a Multinomial Logistic Regression Model. This model tried classify if a TIF district would receive a positive or negative/no transfer. The data was heavily skewed towards the negative/no transfer end which caused the model to predict "negative transfer" 95% of the time.

- Does TIF district demographics determine how much property tax is extracted?

## Results and Conclusions Summary
This section will highlight our most notable results. This will include statistical analysis of the relationship between TIF transfers, TIF fund allocation, race/ethnicity, income level, and property value.

Ethical Reflection:
During this project, we reflected on ethical outcomes that may come from our analysis. When thinking of the impact TIF districts have, we identified Chicago residents, more specifically minorities, as stakeholders. This project looked to answer whether are equitably being used across the city which is important to our stakeholders because the city claims that TIFs are meant to create opportunities for all residents. While making progress on this analysis, we continued to provide transparency and respect for individuals when searching for demographic indicators that influence the allocation of TIF funds across districts. By providing transparency, we are honest in explaining how we came to our conclusions and aiming to help minorities in Chicago that are overlooked by society.
