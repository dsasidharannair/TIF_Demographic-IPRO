**About the Project:
Our project delves into investigating the relationship between the demographics of Tax Increment Financing (TIF) districts and the allocation of funds within them. Inspired by CivicLab's TIF illumination project, which highlighted disparities in TIF fund distribution based on race in Chicago, our aim is to broaden this analysis to encompass various demographic factors such as age, income level, ethnicity, and more. By exploring potential correlations between demographics and TIF fund allocation, we seek to identify any inequities that may exist within the system.

This research is vital as it serves as a foundational step towards advocating for more equitable TIF policies. By gathering and presenting statistical evidence of potential disparities in fund allocation, we aim to inform policymakers and stakeholders, ultimately fostering dialogue and action towards creating fairer TIF policies.

**What is the problem?
Chicago has historically had a problem with allocating funds for government programs in an equitable manner. Many demographics have largely been underfunded, ignored, or discriminated against which has snowballed into larger and larger inequalities between groups of people such as gaps in wealth, income, education, health, and crime. Addressing these issues is an important step to help uplift these groups and correct the wrongs of the past. If we are able to find correlations that show certain demographics are being treated unequally when it comes to distributing TIF funds, then these issues can be addressed and corrected by crafting and passing better policies. 

**Results and Conclusions Summary
This section will highlight our most notable results. This will include statistical analysis of the relationship between TIF transfers, TIF fund allocation, race/ethnicity, income level, and property value. This will also include visualizations of demographics side-by-side with TIF transfers to show what communities may be overlooked.
